Isle of Everwar is designed to be a completely custom online RPG people can play in their browser.  It includes an editor so that each deployment can be a unique world, with unique NPCs, monsters and quests.

In Isle of Everwar, there are no player levels, and no XP.  What your characters do impacts their basic statistics, and your statistics are all that limit your choices of expertise.  If you want to be a Rogue Alchemist Mage, or Merchant Priest Assassin, so be it.  Just get those stats up through quests and combat, then find the right NPC to train you.

The basic concept behind Isle of Everwar is that two rival cultures are trying to settle and control one island (or continent depending on how big and how many maps you make).  As players complete quests on behalf of a culture, the fealty of the map within which they complete the quest shifts slightly towards that player's culture.  Missions can change depending on the loyalty of the region, and once the entire land is under one culture's control, new bonus missions can arise.

This project provides the framework to build and play in such a world.  It contains none of the content, which must be provided by you for you.
